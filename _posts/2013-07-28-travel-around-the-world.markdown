The nature of the human spirit is one of discovery and adventure. We are constantly learning and striving to understand our world and our place in it. So what better way to start then traveling around the world?

Today I have set a goal. Within five years, I will buy a Round The World travel ticket and traverse the globe. I'm not certain if I will take one year to do this, or perhaps six or eight months. In either case, setting the goal is the first step.

I've been thinking about this trip seriously after reading [Alex MacCaw's blog][travel-post] post and realizing that taking this trip is possible. So why wait five years? Based on my current financials, within five years, my $80,000 school loan should be paid and I will have saved enough money for the trip.

So my goal is simple: see as much as I can in the time allotted. If thinking about the journey was step one, this blog post is step two. And as the legendary Laozi wrote sometime in 600 B.C., "the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."[^quote] Of course, traveling around the world will be closer to 25,000 miles--which is a lot of steps!

[^quote]:  The original quote is more closely translated to "The journey of a thousand miles begins beneath one's feet," emphasizing that taking action is the most important 'step.'
