This is certainly how I feel sometimes. I've only just begin professionally programming now for a few months. Before that I spent about a year and a half studying everything I could about programming. Learning about variables, arrays, strings and Ruby, Rails, JQuery, JavaScript and MySQL and NoSQL and MongoDB and on and on...

![Rabbit Hole][hole]

And yet, no matter how much I plunge down the proverbial rabbit hole, there is still so much to learn. I suppose that's one of my favorite joys in my newfound profession. There's always more to learn.

But this can have a drawback as well. One in which I feel I can never quite master my domain. Or perhaps I just need to be patient. It didn't take me long to feel like I had mastered conversion rate optimization and other aspects of online marketing. And while there was still more to learn in marketing, it's no where near what it's like learning how to code.

So if you're like me and starting out on your coding journey, humbly stumbling along, celebrating small victories (like pushing your app to [Heroku][heroku] or squashing a bug after scouring [Stack Overflow][stack]) don't get discouraged about how deep the rabbit hole really goes, or where it ends. Just enjoy the ride.
