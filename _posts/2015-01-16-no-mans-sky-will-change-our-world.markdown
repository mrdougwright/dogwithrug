You will die before ever fully exploring the game world of No Man's Sky. Think about that. A game in which the 'map' is so big, so full of planets and star systems to explore--of thousands of different species to discover--that you physically do not have enough time _in your life_ to see it all.

No Man's Sky is a procedurally generated sci-fi game from the UK studio Hello Games. It is quickly gaining media attention as eager fans await its 2016 release, itching to explore its infinite map.

But what exactly is procedural generation? Surprisingly, the technology has been around since the 1980's, when disk space was scarce and some game makers chose to create levels using algorithmic formulas, rather than store the information as images on disk. In 1986 Firebird published [The Sentinel][the-sentinel], a game that used procedural formulas to generate 10,000 crude levels based off of an 8-bit code.

In today's traditional games, hundreds of artists design levels, creatures and other material needed to render inside a game. These images are then loaded from disc upon boot or when you move your character on a defined map. In No Man's Sky, the planets, the creatures, and almost everything else generates from a set of algorithms used to define the world around the player. As [Sean Murray][no-mans-sky-video], co-founder of Hello Games, explains it, 

"Every planet has a single number, a random seed, that defines everything about that planet. A single random seed generates every blade of grass, tree, flower, creature."

If a planet is a certain distance from its nearest star, it might have water. If it has water, it has an atmosphere. The atmosphere then affects the light color as its diffracted through the sky. This may cause certain types of trees to be generated on this planet, that have a certain type of herbivore, et cetera. The world is a layered set of rules, and the random outcome is the game itself.

*Game of Life 1970 - Conway*

This idea of simple rules creating a kind of chaos was famously exemplified in [John Conway's Game of Life][game-of-life-conway]. In Conway's game, a dot either 'lives' or 'dies' on an indefinite grid. If there are a certain number of dots near an empty space, a new dot is born. Too many neighboring dots, and a dot dies--removed from its position on the grid. Setup a pattern like the one above (designed by a group at MIT), and you have the Glider Gun--an automatic 'life' creating machine.

Conway's game is interesting because of its analogy to real life. Are the complexities of our own world, our bodies and our minds, merely a result of a set of simple rules? Start with one big bang, create 118 elements on the periodic table, fast forward billions of years and here we are: complex creatures in an ever increasingly complex world. And now we're creating our own universes, inside a game where even the creators don't know what they'll find.

Of course, computers aren't magic. A computer doesn't _know_ how to create an infinite universe, or even add two plus two. Instead, it looks up '2' and '+' and '2' and returns a result. (The late physicist, [Richard Feynman][Richard_Feynman] explains how this works). Essentially, computers are advanced filing cabinets, or memory systems. The programs we run on them are just instructions that tell the file clerk what file to get. But with over 60 years of software development, our programs are both simpler to use and vastly complex, with thousands of instruction sets under the hood.

This advanced tech allows a small game company like Hello Games, with a relatively small amount of software or 'seed' planting, to create a generated, undiscovered infinite universe. (Murray has calculated it would take one person, discovering one planet _every second_, about 585 billion years to find them all.) In a sense, this is a new kind of artificial intelligence. One in which thousands upon thousands of worlds, filled with various plants and animals, has been created with the help of a machine.

Forty years ago Conway couldn’t have imagined the vast complexities that would arise from his simple game of life. Hello Games developers continue to surprise themselves today as they debug their own game and explore the unknown that they helped create. For this alone, No Man’s Sky will certainly leave its mark in the history of game development. But what other ripple effects will this game cause?

Perhaps it will be remembered for its communities, bringing people together as they share their journeys. Perhaps the concept and its software will inspire more students towards careers in computer science. Perhaps its advanced use of tech will change the way games are made, or advance applications in AI and other areas of software.

One thing is certain, the beginnings of artificial intelligence is here. We now have software that can take a few components and create seemingly infinite and undiscovered worlds. What else will we create with the help of machines? For now, our future with AI is unknown. Like the universe of No Man's Sky, its planets and galaxies lie waiting, yet to be explored.
