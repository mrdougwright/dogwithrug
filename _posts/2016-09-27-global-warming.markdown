If you haven't seen Al Gore's 2016 TED talk on global warming, watch it now:

Yesterday at work I had the privilege to hear Al Gore give the two hour version of his presentation on climate change. Of course, I have seen [An Inconvenient Truth][inconvenient_truth] in 2006 and have since known about the destructive environmental effects of humanity on planet earth. However, for the past several years, I haven't thought about it much. Besides donating to a few environment-focused nonprofit organizations, buying energy efficient light bulbs, and walking or riding a bicycle when I can, I've mostly forgotten about global warming.

But each day is a new day to reinvest my commitment to change, so I thought I would do my part and share the video. Looking at this graph, it's easy to see how we affect the planet. Our population has literally grown in conjunction with oil consumption and its corresponding co2 emissions.

Climate change is real, the debate is over. The days are getting hotter and the oceans are dying. The warming of our planet is a major contributor to famine, drought, storms, extinction, disease, political instability--the list goes on. But I believe there is hope, that we can change. Renewable energy is growing, electric cars are fashionable, people are more aware of the climate crisis.

As I get older and think about the next generation that has to inherit what we left behind, I realize that there is much more work to be done, and simply more work that I can do. We're on the precipice. I can envision a future of destruction, war and pollution. But I can also see a world with clean air, clean energy and prosperity. Despite seemingly overwhelming darkness, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
