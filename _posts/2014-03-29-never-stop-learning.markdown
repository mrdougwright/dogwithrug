# Why do we like vacation?

![vacation in Thailand][thailand]

I know the obvious reasons. It's relaxing, it's a break from work, from our routine, it's fun. But what does it really do for us; why is it fun? Why is it so exciting to venture to an unknown country? To explore some place new?

I think the answer may be the same reason people like a good book or an interesting movie. It may be the same reason I like writing code. Or film making, playing guitar, photography and backpacking. What do all these activities have in common? Does writing code have anything in common with backpacking out into the woods?

Discovering a programming language and learning the vast ways in which various methods work  is not quite different than exploring the wilderness with a map and compass. Okay, they are completely different, but they share a common trait. In fact, all of the activities I've mentioned share this trait.

It's the act of *learning something new*.

Vacationing to a new city, unraveling a good story through film or reading, studying a new coding technique, mastering photography, playing a new guitar song, exploring a new trail--these activities all have one thing in common. They create new neural networks in your brain because you're forcing your brain to learn something new.

This might explain why taking vacations to the same spot can grow stale. If you already know where to go, how to get around, what to do, then you're not learning anything new, you're not exploring. The same could be said about a cranky programmer who remains within the confines of one language, never going outside the comfort zone to explore the unknown.

I think we're happiest when our brains are fed a constant stream of new things to learn. And the really cool thing is that the subject doesn't matter. Bill Clinton's getting a kick out of taking on [particle physics][bill clinton]. Last night I created a few more neural pathways by learning how to paint. Today I'll dive a bit deeper into photography.

Life is short. So whatever your interest, whatever your curiosity, take a minute from the routine and go exploring.
