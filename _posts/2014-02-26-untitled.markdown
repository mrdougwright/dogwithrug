This rant is less about coding and more about evolution, heavily inspired if not completely stolen from a talk given by [Danny Hillis at TED in 1994][hillis].

Hillis is an American engineer and inventor, known for his work on parallel supercomputing. In his talk he discusses the transition we are in right now, as human beings on this earth.

2.5 billion years
- chemicals learn to write down information about themselves to pass on to the next chemicals - DNA

billion years
- chemicals begin to communicate with each other and create communities = cells, using DNA. survive or fail together. surviving chemicals favored by evolution.

100 million years
- multi-cellular communities working together to write down their DNA in one place - an organism. skin cell is useless without brain cells, heart cells, etc.

100 thousand years
- communities of cells begin to abstract information, building special structures - neurons. Special structures responsible for recording and learning information - brain and the nervous system. Meant that learning could happen within lifetime of single organism, not just evolutionary. --speeds up evolution

10 thousand years or so
- now these organisms could use the special structures to create language, to present another way of recording and learning information. Communicating with each other through language

less than a thousand, or perhaps just a few hundred, years
computers
- random sequence of instructions generated by the computer to sort numbers, low to high. take the best one, which may sort only two numbers correctly, and instruct the computer to use that sequence of instructions with a previous set and create another set of random algorithms (analagous to sex and producing children). combinations of programs doing a better job. Each of these generations take a few milliseconds. In a few minutes, or perhaps a few hours, an extremely efficient program can sort numbers, better than one Hillis could write himself, let alone even fully understand.

We begin to depend on computers to create things with more complexity than we can understand. It's speeding ahead of us, feeding back on itself.

"We're the amoebas and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating." - Hillis

We are a part of producing that next thing.
