This post is less about coding and more about evolution, heavily inspired if not completely copied from a talk given by [Danny Hillis at TED in 1994][hillis].

Hillis is an American engineer and inventor, known for his work on parallel supercomputing. In his talk he discusses the transition we are in right now, as human beings on this earth.

At about 4.5 billion years ago, interstellar gases and rock bonded together around the sun's gravitational pull to create Earth. Let's race through this history to see it from a distant perspective.

At 2.5 billion years the Earth's atmosphere begins to form. Scientists actually have a name for this--the [Great Oxygenation Event][GOE]. It's at this time that chemicals learn to write down information about themselves to pass on to the next generation of chemicals. The beginnings of DNA.

Information that is passed on, like photosynthesis, allows Cyanobacteria to adopt the _sun's energy_, instead of that from nearby organic material. This adaptation has a side effect, however, creating oxygen as a biproduct and perhaps the largest extinction event of life on earth. One in which almost all non-oxygen (anaerobic) inhabitants die off.

Fast forward a few more hundred million years and chemicals begin to communicate with each other and create communities, or what we call cells. Now we're moving from bacteria to things like plants. Cellular communities that survive or fail together, dependant upon the success of their evolution.

Just a few hundred million years ago and we have multi-cellular communities working together to write down their DNA in one place. We call this an organism. A community of skin cells is useless without heart cells or lung cells, etc.

Advancing further, communities of cells begin to abstract information, building special structures or neurons. These special structures are responsible for recording and learning information for the individual. Now you have things like a brain and a nervous system. This meant that learning could happen within a lifetime of a single organism, not just on an evolutionary timeline.

Only a few ten thousand years ago and these organisms start to use their (relativley) newly formed brains to create language. With language you now have another recording device to aid in evolution.

Now within a mere hundred years we have computers. Highly advanced machines for speed of repetition, but certainly not intelligent. At least not yet. Hillis describes todays machines as if we're at the cellular level in the history of the earth, only we don't have to wait millions of years for the next great leap.

To describe the speed at which computing is evolving, Hillis explains how he "teaches" a machine to do computation. He starts by asking the machine for several random sequences of instructions, with the goal of using one to sort numbers, say, low to high.

Out of 99.9% of the computer-generated algorithms created only a few come close, and perhaps sort only 2 or 3 numbers successfully. And so he takes those more successful algorithms and tells the machine to use _these_ algorithms to produce another set of algorithms (think of algorithms merging with each other to have children). And the process repeats until you have a computer-generated algorithm that can sort numbers faster and with more precision than any program a human could write. Even more striking is the fact that Hillis himself cannot even comprehend the computer's code, but he knows it works.

What happens as we begin to depend on computers to create things with more complexity than we ourselves can understand? Are we creating the next advancement in evolution, perhaps the first true [artificial intelligence][AI]?

As Hillis points out, we are a part of producing that next thing, whatever it may be.
