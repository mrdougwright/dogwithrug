A fundamental aspect to programming is abstraction. Identify a pattern in something and abstract it. Take it away from its constraints and (hopefully) simplify it and replicate it elsewhere.

An unexpected by-product of my [journey][journey] into programming is the growing ability to see patterns and abstract problems. It reminds me of the time when I was taking Editing 101 at film school. Back then it was tough for me to enjoy watching a film, because all I could do was see the edits. Every time the camera moved or the scene cut or the frame faded to the next frame, I was enthralled. I'd practically jump out of my seat and point to the screen thinking, "Did you see that cut?!"

This was because I was learning how to 'compile' a film in school with editing techniques. Learning how to lure the eye with different cuts, to engage the mind; to follow the main character and blend thoughts and emotions with fade-ins, mashups, framing, etc. To understand why Walter Murch edited scenes in Apocalypse Now the way he did.

And so while watching any movie, I would focus on how the editor(s) put their film together to construct the story. This would break my 'suspension of disbelief' and make it a bit harder to simply sit and enjoy the film. If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch one of your favorite movies again and pay attention to every camera change. Or check out my re-edit of the [Bottle Rocket trailer][bottle_trailer]. Notice the amount of information packed into one minute, and that there is no soundtrack.

So now I tend to see patterns or abstractions in everyday life, much in the same way I would notice interesting edits in a film. One that occurred to me recently is a problem in the service market, currently being solved by a few software companies.

Technology makes it easier and faster to connect people. Think about our progression with the speed of communication. We went from handwritten letters to telephones to the Internet in a fairly short amount of time. Obviously it is tremendously easier for a person to trade a good or service today than it was in the 1800's. Making a connection is as easy as posting an ad on Craigslist. Or is it?

See, if that were true, other web service companies like Airbnb, 99designs, Zimride and Lyft would not be growing. Sure, these companies do a lot more than simply make connections, but one could argue that you could bypass their fancy services altogether and just use Craigslist. (In fact, some people do).

Yet, these companies are successful because they have abstracted one of the biggest problems in the service economy and solved it. And that problem is trust.

Trust is essential to any transaction or service agreement. And so, although one can share his car or rent her apartment or trade goods on a portal like Craigslist, one cannot rely on that company to provide a level of trust between the buyer and the seller. That's where 3rd party companies like Airbnb come in, guaranteeing property protection in case of an untrustworthy guest, or Zimride, validating users with their social networks and ratings, so that you're not just hopping into a car with a stranger. Well, at least not a _complete_ stranger.

It might seem too abstract, but these companies are essentially solving a trust issue. Create trust within a valuable service first, then scale with thousands of happy users and you have a great business. In the service economy, providing trust is the tipping point. It's the unseen force holding it all together. In the movies, we call that good editing.
