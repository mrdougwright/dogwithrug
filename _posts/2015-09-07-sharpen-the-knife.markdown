I’m 34 years old. This is the first day of the rest of my life.

I’ve always liked that line, or something like it, from _American Beauty_. In the movie, Kevin Spacey’s character is waking up from a mid-life crisis. He loses his job, his wife is cheating on him in his mediocre marriage, and he’s looking around and wondering how he got there. What has he accomplished in his life? Who is the man he has turned out to be?

_This is the first day of the rest of my life._

The line is supposed to conjure feelings of hope and promise, to awaken the days of latin yore and carpe diem, seize the day. This is the present moment, you have your whole life ahead of you from this moment and this moment only. What are you going to do with it? It’s a great line from the movie, because he says it (spoiler alert) on the day he is killed, knowing it’s his last day on earth.

So what am I writing about at 3:30am in the morning? I’m visiting my parents at their beach house. They are sound asleep in the next room. The dog is sound asleep on the floor. My wife is out cold in the bed next to me. But I’m awake, spewing my thoughts into a google doc listening to the waves break on the shore from outside the window.

34 years old. I thought I’d be a millionaire by now. Having wrote, produced, and directed a few feature films in my late twenties, paying back my art school loans, and purchasing my own house by the beach--this is where my life should be at 34. Another day dream never materialized. Perhaps I’d be awake at 3:30am in that life too? Pondering. Wanting for more.

I’m certainly not unhappy with the way things turned out. I’m just wondering if it’s time for a change. I’m yearning for that Kevin Spacey moment where I turn my life 180 degrees and mold the world around me to what I want. And I have a confession to make: I want to be remembered.

Really, I want to leave my mark, to achieve something amazing, to change the world. Last night the family and I went out to the movies to watch _Steve Jobs: Man in the Machine_. I’m not a Jobs fanatic, but after watching that movie, I must say that I am envious. Jobs had so much passion, so much drive, and perhaps more importantly, he had a vision. A vision of the future, of what computers could be for people, and he sought to complete that vision.

Perhaps that’s what’s lacking. What’s my vision? During my first semester in film school I experienced a rather baffling and troublesome moment of clarity. I realized that though I wanted to be like the great storytellers, the Stanley Kubricks and other great directors I idolized, I had absolutely no story to tell. Even worse, I began to feel that making a living from storytelling had no meaning. You have one shot in this life, to achieve great things, and you’re going to tell stories? It seemed absurd. I should have dropped out right then and there.

Of course, the irony is that you don’t need to be an original storyteller. Kubrick and Tarantino and many others made most of their movies from adaptations of written material. And so I learned that the true artists were those that could conceive and write the story in the first place. I’ve since written two unfinished novels, both pretty bad, one that could potentially turn into another mediocre self published kindle piece of crap.

The reality is that most of us will not be remembered. Over 7 billion people on the planet, there’s too many damn people for all of us to shine bright. Reality is that I’m simply another generation X or Y or whomever that’s been told his whole life that he’s special and that he can do anything I put my mind to and am now waking up and have been for several years, realizing that I am not special, I cannot do anything that I want and that I will not achieve greatness.

I read somewhere that the desire to be famous or remembered is simply a fear of the mind in wanting to live forever. Traditionally, humans have solved this innate problem by having children, spreading their genes and vicariously living on through their sons and daughters. With the advent of media and fame, sparked at the turn of the 20th century with cinema and the rise of industry, one can now live forever without a family. You just have to achieve something memorable, like Thomas Edison, or be famous like James Dean.

But I’m not looking for fame. I’m looking for something greater. For purpose. To find my skill and grow it and use it to make a lasting difference. To leave a mark. I thought that skill was an intellectual mind, a way of looking at the world, and that I could use that skill to make movies. Perhaps I still can? Then I thought I could write stories, use that introspection, that wandering mind to write stories, to invent moving fictions. Maybe. Lately I thought I could learn to code, tap into a hidden, brilliant mind that just needed to find the right medium, and then I would write spellbinding software, that I would find my groove.

Well, I can hack it as a web developer. And I can piece together a story with some two dimensional characters and a steady plot, and maybe cut some shots together to make a home movie, but I certainly don’t feel that any of these crafts are my true calling.

I’ve recently read a book on philosophy entitled [Neo Nihilism][neo-nihilism]. In it, the author expounds on the teachings of Nietzsche and others to explain our lives and how we live. There’s one point I continually come back to as I try to understand my current plight in life.

> _The purpose of a knife is to cut, therefore it ought to be sharp. A knife has a purpose as it was designed by man with the purpose in mind._

> _But man himself was not designed, his complexity is explained not by creation but by evolution...without a god, man has no purpose, there is no absolute meaning to life._

As a product of evolution, I wasn’t made with a purpose. So I guess it’s up to me to stake out and find my own. To keep searching. Time to sharpen the knife.
