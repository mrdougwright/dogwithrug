I am sure I'm not the first person to write about the phenomena that is plaguing the populace of the early 21st century. One might call it the age of social media (whatever that means), but I think there's more to it. Spurred by the Maslow growth of technology, our society has been swept into a new age.

We live now in the age of the selfie. The age of _you_ tube, of 140 characters and never-ending streams of endless photos; the age of infinite game worlds and self publishing, of excessive consumerism, voyeurism, and abundant narcissism; the age of me.

Look at me world. Here I am. See my post? I'm smiling on my vacation. I'm expressing my political ideology in a string of text. I like this post, this page, this comment. I'm expressing myself. This is my voice. This is my click.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not griping. Rather, I'm coming to a realization. They say the world is what you make of it. I would argue that the world is a collection of millions of little worlds, created in our minds and expressed outward on the web, perhaps connecting briefly, superficially, to other like-minded bubbles, but ultimately filling the endless void with noise.

Twenty years ago you might have had a cell phone, and if you did, you used it to talk to people. Now we are glued to our phones, our heads down and necks strained as we scroll through our streams, checking into our little worlds and feeding our noise into the big machine.

We detach from society at the same time in which we believe we are connecting. First it was TV, compartmentalizing the family unit as we bask semi-circle in its warm glow. Now we are further removed, each with our own device. Our own tool to create our very own content. To reach the masses while ironically falling onto def ears.

Sometimes I think all this data, all these clicks and photos and likes and comments, will be amassed into a giant repository. And there, years from now, some future race of humans will study this data. They, of course, will be far beyond who we are today; evolved long ago from hu-man to bionic man to artificial man. Something akin to the singularity, if you like, a species enhanced beyond our physical bodies, more technology than flesh. How else could they survive the wasteland of the Earth?

And looking into this sea of data, they will analyze us--their ancestors--hypothesizing as to who we are. They might ask, What did they do? What did they feel? What was it like, to be human? To have a personality? To have a soul?

And so as we mindlessly follow the crowd, adding our droplets to the ocean of this data sea, my hope is that it's not wasted. Like diamonds strewn against blacken sand, I hope future archaeologists can find clarity amidst the noise. Substance in a world so detached and vacant. God help them if all they find are cat videos.
