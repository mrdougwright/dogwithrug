"Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice; it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved."  ~ Winston Churchill

None of us are born anything. We're not born rock stars, politicians, or CEOs, we're not born to be movie stars or famous authors. The obscurity of these positions, the natural limit to their availability in the world, proves that we can't all hope to become someone remarkable. Most of us will never come close to achieving a place in history. And this is upsetting.

From an early age I was taught to study hard and I could achieve anything I dreamed. If I wanted to be an astronaut or the next president, no problem. And for a while, I might have believed that. When you're raised this way, the world feels like it's yours, and that you can truly do what you set your mind to. But as you grow older, you start to see the fallacy in this. You begin to see that you are, like many of those around you, simply...ordinary. 

I came to realize this after breaking into the film business in Los Angeles. After hundreds of unpaid hours I managed to get my foot in the door and slowly crawl my way up. It soon became apparent that my dream of producing/directing/writing was going to take a lot longer than I thought--and that it might never happen at all.

During my last week working for a small independent film company, I remember my boss telling me, "If I could do something else I would. You're good with computers. Why don't you do that?"

The climb back into the tech world compared to Hollywood was night and day. In the city of angels I struggled for three-plus years and grew my salary by about five percent. Coming back to San Francisco I managed to triple my salary within a year and a half.

It's true, destiny doesn't happen by chance, you have to choose it. But with our limited time on this earth, given the scenarios in which we live, making smart choices based on one's circumstances can prove invaluable. For me, it was realizing that I could be creative in not only filmmaking, but also marketing and programming. Pursuing a career in a growing industry meant not having to struggle against so many peers and a weak economy.

I still wonder what would have happened had I stayed in Los Angeles. Would I have 'made it'? I guess I'll really never know. But one thing I know for sure is that I wouldn't be on the path I am now--and that road is just as wild and uncharted as any other.
