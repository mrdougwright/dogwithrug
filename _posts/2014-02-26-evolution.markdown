This post is heavily inspired--if not completely copied--from a talk given by [Danny Hillis at TED in 1994][hillis].

Hillis is an American engineer and inventor, known for his work on parallel supercomputing. In his talk he discusses the transition we are in, us human beings on this earth, and what might be happening with our future.

![Interstellar gas and rock][gases]

At about 4.5 billion years ago, interstellar gases and rock bonded together around the sun's gravitational pull to create Earth. Let's race through this history to see it from a distant perspective.

At 2.5 billion years the Earth's atmosphere begins to form. Scientists actually have a name for this--the [Great Oxygenation Event][GOE]. It's at this time that chemicals learn to write down information about themselves, to pass on to the next generation of chemicals. The beginnings of DNA.

Information that is passed on, like photosynthesis, allows things like Cyanobacteria to utilize the _sun's energy_ instead of organic material nearby. This adaptation has a side effect, creating oxygen as a byproduct and perhaps the largest extinction event of life on earth. One in which almost all non-oxygen or anaerobic inhabitants die off.

Fast forward a few more hundred million years and chemicals begin to communicate with each other and create communities, or what we call cells. We move from bacteria to plants. Cellular communities that survive or fail together, dependent upon the success of their evolution, how well they adapt to their environment.

Just a few hundred million years more and we have multi-cellular communities working together to write down their DNA in one place. We call this an organism. Hillis points out that a community of skin cells is useless without heart cells or lung cells, but working together they create a complex creature.

Advancing further, communities of cells begin to abstract information, building special structures or neurons. These special structures are responsible for recording and learning information for the individual. Now you have things like a brain and a nervous system. This meant that learning could happen within a lifetime of a single organism, not just on an evolutionary time line.

Only a few ten thousand years ago and these organisms start to use their newly formed brains to create language. With language you now have another recording device to aid in evolution. Not only can the individual adapt to its surroundings with its nervous system, but also as a community of individuals using shared knowledge through language. For example, the creation of fire with sticks or stone, passed down through generations.

![early man][prehistoric]

Within a hundred years we now have computers. Highly advanced machines with immense storage capacity and speed, but certainly not intelligent. At least not yet.

Hillis describes todays machines as if they're at the cellular level in the history of the earth--only we don't have to wait millions of years for the next great leap. To describe the speed at which computing is evolving, Hillis explains how he "teaches" a machine to do computation.

He starts by asking the machine for several random sequences of instructions, with the goal of using one of these instruction sets or algorithms to sort numbers. 99.9% of the computer-generated algorithms created don't work, but a few come _close_ to sorting numbers successfully.

![google-computers][google-computers]

And so he takes those more successful algorithms and tells the machine to use _these_ algorithms to produce yet another set of algorithms (analogous to sex and having children). Now these children produce slightly more algorithms that come closer to successfully sorting numbers.

So the process repeats until you have a computer-generated algorithm that can sort numbers faster and with more precision than any program a human could ever write. Even more striking is the fact that Hillis himself cannot even comprehend the computer's code.

What happens as we begin to depend on computers to create things with more complexity than we ourselves can understand? Are we creating the next advancement in evolution? Perhaps the first true [artificial intelligence][AI]?

> *- Hillis*

As Hillis points out, we are a part of producing that next thing, whatever it may be. Our amazing advancement in technologies and computing can be seen as just another step in evolution. As we write down the next line of code and create more software to run our world, perhaps we're just setting up a foundation for the next thing to come along.

We may not have been created if Cyanobacteria hadn't learned to get its energy from the sun, start producing more oxygen, more of itself, and wipe out anaerobic inhabitants as a result, creating a world for oxygen breathing things like ourselves.

Now we're here, using this oxygen, adapting to our environment; learning, improving, sharing knowledge, creating thousands of things. Creating polluting side effects that may wipe out humanity altogether. But as we manipulate our own environment (perhaps pushing ourselves to the brink of extinction) remember that a computer doesn't need oxygen. Evolution does not need people. It needs only _learnings_ to be written down, whether it be in DNA, a human language or even a program.

As computers begin to write better instructions than we can, to store information for the next inhabitants; as we mold them to behave like us, to exist longer than our limited human bodies, perhaps a distant future may not include us at all--except as some historical evolutionary step.
