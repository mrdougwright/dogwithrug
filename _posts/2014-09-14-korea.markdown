It's been months since my last blog post. With getting a new job, traveling to Korea and enjoying the summer, I guess that's natural. I've also started writing a 2nd novel, so that may be part of the reason for my lack of blog entries.

In addition to these excuses, I haven't thought of anything particularly interesting to write about. So here are a few pictures from my trip. Enjoy!
